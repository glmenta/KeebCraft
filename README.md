### What is KeebCraft?
Keebcraft is a fullstack application that utilizes user-created components stored in the database to create custom mechanical keyboards that are then showcased to other users. 

### Why KeebCraft?
As a passionate mechanical keyboard enthusiast, I sought to create an app that allows users to visualize and combine different arrays of components that they could share
to the rest of the mechanical keyboard community.
